A collection of sample code and snippets showing how to access Exchange using EWS.

[EWS Trace Listener](https://github.com/David-Barrett-MS/EWS-Sample-Code/blob/main/EWSTraceListener.cs): 
This is a simple trace listener class that can be added to a project that uses the EWS Managed API, and used to dump the whole EWS conversation to a file.  Tracing is essential for debugging EWS applications.  Traces produced by this trace listener can be loaded and analysed in the [SOAPe](https://github.com/David-Barrett-MS/SOAPe) log viewer.
